# DHCP-Pool-Project
This repository explores the impact of DHCP pool size on network performance using Packet Tracer simulations.

Simulations:

Lease Renewal Time: Analyzes how a limited pool can affect lease renewal times for numerous clients, potentially causing network congestion.
Address Exhaustion: Demonstrates how an undersized pool can prevent new devices from acquiring IP addresses and joining the network.
Target Audience:

Network administrators and engineers.
IT students or professionals interested in network performance factors.
Anyone curious about DHCP and its influence on network behavior.
Learning Objectives:

Understand the importance of proper DHCP pool configuration.
Gain insights into IP address allocation and lease renewal processes.
Explore how DHCP pool size affects network efficiency.
Requirements:

Packet Tracer (available from Cisco Networking Academy)
